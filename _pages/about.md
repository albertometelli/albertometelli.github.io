Since March 2023, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering with the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria 
([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/)), in the Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Laboratory ([AIRLab](http://airlab.deib.polimi.it/)) 
of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). In March 2021, I received the  Ph.D. in Information Technology at Politecnico di 
Milano (with honors), defending the dissertation "[Exploiting Environment Configurability in Reinforcement Learning](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/170616)",
under the supervision of Prof. [Marcello Restelli](http://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/index.shtml). 
In July 2015, I obtained the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (with honors) and in July 2017, 
I received the Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (with honors), 
defending the thesis "[Compatible Reward Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/135141)". Since November 2021, I am an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Member.

Research Interests
---
My research interests focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, in particular <b>Reinfocement Learning</b>. I am currently working on theoretical
and algorithmic aspects of:
* <b>Inverse Reinforcement Learning</b>
* <b>Efficient Sample (Re)Use in Reinforcement Learning</b>
* <b>Multi-Armed Bandits</b>
* <b>Automated Reinforcement Learning</b>

I am also interested in algorithms, optimization, statistics, probability, and recommendation systems.
