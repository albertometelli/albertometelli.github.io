Abstract
 <br> We study the problem of identifying the policy space of a learning agent, having access to a set of demonstrations generated by its optimal policy. We introduce an approach based on statistical testing to identify the set of policy parameters the agent can control, within a larger parametric policy space. After presenting two identification rules (combinatorial and simplified), applicable under different assumptions on the policy space, we provide a probabilistic analysis of the simplified one in the case of linear policies belonging to the exponential family. To improve the performance of our identification rules, we frame the problem in the recently introduced framework of the Configurable Markov Decision Processes, exploiting the opportunity of configuring the environment to induce the agent revealing which parameters it can control. Finally, we provide an empirical evaluation, on both discrete and continuous domains, to prove the effectiveness of our identification rules. <br>
