abstract = {A drought is a slowly developing natural phenomenon that can occur in all climatic zones and can be defined as a temporary but significant decrease in water availability. Over the past three decades, the cost of droughts in Europe amounted to over 100 billion euros, with the recent summer droughts being unprecedented in the last 2,000 years. Although drought monitoring and management are extensively studied in the literature, capturing the evolution of drought dynamics, and associated impacts across different temporal and spatial scales remains a critical, unsolved challenge. In this work, we contribute with a Machine Learning procedure named FRIDA (FRamework for Index-based Drought Analysis) for the identification of impact-based drought indexes. FRIDA is a fully automated data-driven approach that relies on advanced feature extraction algorithms to identify relevant drought drivers from a pool of candidate hydro-meteorological predictors. The selected predictors are then combined into an index representing a surrogate of the drought conditions in the considered area, including either observed or simulated water deficits or remotely sensed information on crop status. Notably, FRIDA leverages multi-task learning algorithms to upscale the analysis over a large region where drought impacts might depend on diverse but potentially correlated drivers. FRIDA captures the heterogeneous features of the different sub-regions while efficiently using all available data and exploiting the commonalities across sub-regions. In this way, the accuracy of the resulting prediction benefits from a reduced uncertainty compared to training separate models for each sub-region. Several real-world examples will be used to provide a synthesis of recent applications of FRIDA in case studies featuring diverse hydroclimatic conditions and variable levels of data availability.}

abstract = {Hydropower is one of the industrial sectors more strongly affected by the timing and intensity of extreme climatic conditions, especially related to precipitation. Particularly, the recent expansion of the hydropower capacity in South American regions has raised the interest of this sector in seasonal forecasts that can be used to anticipate persistent precipitation anomalies (e.g. meteorological droughts) over specific basins. Some of the limitations for the generation of seasonal forecast products that can be integrated in hydropower decision-making processes are the coarse spatial resolution and the limited forecast quality (i.e. systematic errors, low skill) of the current operational seasonal forecast systems. To overcome this problem, we propose a methodology based on machine learning-informed analogs. Information-theoretic preprocessing has been used to identify the large-scale drivers of precipitation in a drainage basin located in southern Brazil, where hydroelectric energy is produced. This information allows us to exploit the ability of the dynamical seasonal forecast systems to predict these large-scale drivers in combination with the statistical link between these drivers and precipitation. We have employed the global CMCC-SPS35 seasonal forecasts at 1° spatial resolution and the CHIRPS-V2 precipitation dataset at 0.05° to produce dynamical-statistical seasonal forecasts of precipitation. The results show that downscaled forecasts exhibit higher skill and are affected by smaller biases than those obtained directly from the operational dynamical systems. This suggests that there is potential for the use of hybrid forecasts in the optimal management of South Brazilian hydropower production.}

abstract = {A drought is a slowly developing natural phenomenon that can occur in all climatic zones and can be defined as a temporary but significant decrease in water availability. Over the past three decades, the cost of droughts in Europe has amounted to over 100 billion euros and it is expected to considerably increase as future droughts are projected to be more severe and long-lasting. Although drought monitoring and management are largely studied in the literature, they often fail at yielding precise information on critical events occurrence and associated impacts such as reduction of electricity production or crop failures. This is due to the difficulty of capturing the complexity of drought dynamics, which evolve over diverse temporal (and spatial) scales, including short-term meteorological droughts, medium-term agricultural droughts, and long-term hydrological droughts, as well as the non-physical aspects related to droughts (water management, irrigation, etc.).  In this work, we contribute a Machine Learning based framework named FRIDA (FRamework for Index-based Drought Analysis) for the identification of impact-based, site-specific drought indexes. FRIDA is a fully automated data-driven approach that relies on advanced feature extraction algorithms to identify relevant drought drivers from a pool of candidate hydro-meteorological variables. Selected predictors are combined into an index representing a surrogate of the drought conditions in the considered area, including either observed or simulated water deficits or remotely sensed information about the state of the crops. FRIDA is portable across different contexts for supporting the formulation of basin-specific indexes to better inform drought management strategies. Several real-world examples will be used to provide a synthesis of recent applications of FRIDA in case studies featuring diverse hydroclimatic conditions and variable levels of data availability.}
