  abstract={How can we effectively exploit the collected samples when solving a continuous control task with Reinforcement Learning? Recent results have empirically demonstrated that multiple policy optimization steps can be performed with the same batch by using off-distribution techniques based on importance sampling. However, when dealing with off-distribution optimization, it is essential to take into account the uncertainty introduced by the importance sampling process. In this paper, we propose and analyze a class of model-free, policy search algorithms that extend the recent Policy Optimization via Importance Sampling (Metelli et al., 2018) by incorporating two advanced variance reduction techniques: per-decision and multiple importance sampling. For both of them, we derive a high-probability bound, of independent interest, and then we show how to employ it to define a suitable surrogate objective function that can be used for both action-based and parameter-based settings. The resulting algorithms are finally evaluated on a set of continuous control tasks, using both linear and deep policies, and compared with modern policy optimization methods.}

abstract = "The design of high-level decision-making systems is a topical problem in the field of autonomous driving. In this paper, we combine traditional rule-based strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) with the goal of achieving transparency and robustness. On the one hand, the use of handcrafted rule-based controllers allows for transparency, i.e., it is always possible to determine why a given decision was made, but they struggle to scale to complex driving scenarios, in which several objectives need to be considered. On the other hand, black-box RL approaches enable us to deal with more complex scenarios, but they are usually hardly interpretable. In this paper, we combine the best properties of these two worlds by designing parametric rule-based controllers, in which interpretable rules can be provided by domain experts and their parameters are learned via RL. After illustrating how to apply parameter-based RL methods (PGPE) to this setting, we present extensive numerical simulations in the highway and in two urban scenarios: intersection and roundabout. For each scenario, we show the formalization as an RL problem and we discuss the results of our approach in comparison with handcrafted rule-based controllers and black-box RL techniques."

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective approach to solve sequential decision making problems when the environment is equipped with a reward function to evaluate the agent’s actions. However, there are several domains in which a reward function is not available and difficult to estimate. When samples of expert agents are available, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows recovering a reward function that explains the demonstrated behavior. Most of the classic IRL methods, in addition to expert’s demonstrations, require sampling the environment to evaluate each reward function, that, in turn, is built starting from a set of engineered features. This paper is about a novel model-free IRL approach that does not require to specify a function space where to search for the expert’s reward function. Leveraging on the fact that the policy gradient needs to be zero for an optimal policy, the algorithm generates an approximation space for the reward function, in which a reward is singled out employing a second-order criterion. After introducing our approach for finite domains, we extend it to continuous ones. The empirical results, on both finite and continuous domains, show that the reward function recovered by our algorithm allows learning policies that outperform those obtained with the true reward function, in terms of learning speed.},
